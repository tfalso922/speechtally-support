## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Problem: App crashes when opening
**Solutions:**
1. Force close the app (swipe up from app switcher)
2. Restart your device
3. Check for app updates in the App Store
4. Delete and reinstall the app (note: this will clear local data)
5. Contact support with your device model and iOS version

#### Problem: Buttons not responding
**Solutions:**
1. Ensure app is fully loaded (wait 2-3 seconds after opening)
2. Check if device storage is full (Settings → General → Storage)
3. Force close and reopen the app
4. Update to latest app version

#### Problem: Can't edit client names
**Solutions:**
1. Tap directly on the name area (not on Undo/Reset buttons)
2. Allow keyboard to appear (may take 1-2 seconds)
3. Restart app if keyboard doesn't appear

#### Problem: Undo button is grayed out
**This is normal behavior when:**
- No taps have been made yet
- All history has been undone
- A reset was performed (clears history)

#### Problem: Numbers look wrong
**Check:**
- Green (+) button adds to both numerator and denominator
- Red (−) button adds only to denominator
- This is correct behavior for accuracy tracking
- Use Undo if you made a mistake

#### Problem: Lost my data after update
**This is rare, but if it happens:**
1. Check if you have an iCloud backup before the update
2. Restore from backup (Settings → General → Transfer or Reset iPhone)
3. Contact Apple Support if issues persist
